This stuff is
such scientific garbage…like vitamin water…or bottled water period. Whenever I’m
in a restaurant I ask for the clean water, the water from the tap. (It drives
my wife nuts but it’s such fun.)



But there’s no
underestimating the stupidity of the American public.

@Lee Zehrer Since you ask for clean tap water, I take it you do not live in Toledo, Ohio?

@Jorge Gonzalez@Lee Zehrer I was walking
down a grungy back ally in Saigon a few years ago and noticed then filling up
pallets of “pure spring water” bottles with a water hose. And don’t tell me
that doesn’t happen in San Francisco or where ever…seal or no seal.

 Smart move, different category that Coke has no experience in. There are still potential legal liabilities for this whole category of drink, as well as it being just another potential fad.
