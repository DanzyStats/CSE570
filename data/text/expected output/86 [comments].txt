If you really enjoy the taste and buzz of an ice cold Coke do try the real sugar formula found in the product bottled in Mexico. It is now available in limited fashion here in USA. True Coca-Cola flavor!

BS! Author needs at least an elementary understanding of industry before writing. The packaging cost more than the product, i.e., the smaller the package the higher the cost. If there was ever an example of in-elastic demand it would be soft drinks. It is like people who will drive 10 miles to save $.02 on a gallon of gas. Small packaging is a loser, if it was not it would have been done a long time ago....

And frankly, Sandy Douglas championed the big package 20 oz change. But he was and is a smart cookie and learns as he goes. He hasn't survived this long by accident.

I worked at CCE during the "New Coke" introduction. It cost me a bundle in bonus and I will never forget my employees harassed as they did their job. In a chuckle memory an elder woman with a cain was berating my merchandiser-an entry level position. Finally in exasperation he defended himself by saying "M'am if I made those decisions would I be on my knees filling the shelves?" We lost many good hands due to store harassment, unfortunately.When 20oz PET was the latest and greatest, Nielsen rankings were by oz. I expressed my misgivings. It was just too much for the average consumer and we pushed school contracts to the higher PET for profitability to offset fixed cost $mm upfront payments.Our share by consumption soared in the short term and a beloved boss reminded me of my misgivings. He was right, then. I have lost touch with them but would like to reconnect and say "I told you so."

Maybe I'm missing something but if a soda is zero calories, does it matter how big the bottle is? Unless my math teacher way back in high school misled me, zero equals zero.

Headline should be, "Less for More." So sick of companies downsizing products, often accompanied with upping the price. Dutch Boy paint takes the prize from my standpoint, building their promotions on what they openly call a "gallon sale" when their cans have been shrunk to something like 3 quarts.

In the soft drink industry, as others, packaging is the bulk of the cost. The cost of liquid, syrup etc is minuscule compared to can/PET bodies. What matters for Nielsen rankings is consumption per drink. So naturally the successful business model increases consumption while minimizing production costs.Delivery warehouse to shelf is enormously expensive.  Ergo, each trip has relatively fixed costs vs ounces per consumer. It's pretty complex, yet intuitive in the soft drink industry.

As counter-intuitive as it might seem, I think soda sweetened with real sugar may reduce obesity. The fattest people I know drink diet soda and they have not lost weight in the last 20 years. Hunger is caused not only by needed calories but also shrinking stomach size. Diet soda increases stomach pressure for a short term yet when the stomach pressure decreases, a feeling of hunger will return. If a real sugar vs artificial sweetener is used the body's system reacts with less need for additional calories. Not all sweeteners are created equal. Artificial sweeteners with no accompanying calories might be less satisfying in the longer term causing more eating to resolve the craving.

@Tom Wood Wow. All I saw in your comment was psuedo-science, causation, assumptions, and a bare minimum of scientific knowledge.Try educating yourself about hunger from wikipedia and get a sense of what the RESEARCH says - not your unscientific anecdotal experiences - which are completely wrong, by the way.

@Victor CookWow Victor. I assume based on your comment that you didn't read the wikipedia article on hunger.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_%28motivational_state%29If you looked more into what the research said, motivational hunger (which is why most people eat) is not the same as lack of food.Glucose is a simple sugar (monosaccharide) that is easily used for energy and is also stored in muscles and liver as glycogen.Fructose is also a monosaccharide yet is not the preferred energy source for the muscles or the brain. Chronically high intake of dietary fructose appears to behave more like fat than carbohydrates. High fructose corn syrup is cheaper but not the same as sucrose.Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide that is broken down into glucose and fructose. I admit that Wikipedia is not the ideal scientific journal but I also didn't see any scientific research cited in your comment. Maybe you work for a company that creates artificial sweeteners.

Small container size in the US is normal size in Europe and elsewhereWhat will we do with the 10 Big Gulp cup holders in today's SUVs and Minivans??Trend toward deposit laws make small portion sizes less economic for the consumer...so what's more important...recycling incentives or smaller portion size?

Omitted from the article is the size of coke bottles in the 1950s and 60s. They were smaller than 16 ounces, though I can't remember how much.

6 oz, 10 ounce and then upsized to 16 ounce returnable for the same reasons noted above (oz/consumption). But it was a labor disaster. As I recall a case of 16 oz was 35# each. Then the returns, magnet for bottle deposits, higher production costs (line change for sterilization, etc). A pure disaster for display building with labor costs through the roof.Recyclable can bodies at 12oz were a boom and displayed easily. Plus no return truck load of empty bottles to be off loaded.

The optimum serving size is zero oz. Haven't you heard, sugar is the enemy, as demonstrated by the obesity and diabetes epidemic.
