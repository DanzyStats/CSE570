How hard is it for a parent to tell their child no to something unhealthy? Too many parents want to be their childs friend and not their parent, it shouldn't be up to the company to take action for other people's kids.

I don't like the diet drinks...too much stuff that will harm your body. I would like to drink sugar drinks, but with 45 mg of sugar or fructoseina can of soda pop I'm afraid to drink that too. So, I drink beer instead!

The
 American Dream may have been downsized but Americans ever expanding 
waistlines have clearly not. Blame in no small part can go to our 
penchant for the super-sizing of our soft drinks. Long before Americans 
began drinking 13.5 billions of carbonated drinks every year, soda was 
something enjoyed in the confines of the local soda fountain. When soda 
became available for home consumption, the real Mad Men of mid century 
Madison Avenue began hawking soda as a family drink"so good so wholesome
 for everyone including the tiniest of tots." For a collection of 
vintage ads whose message are as dated as the quaint imagery please
