Let's look at who the plaintiff is. Anthony Johnson is a VP and Assoc. Creative Director for Edelman, a PR & Marketing company located in San Francisco.
Here's a quote off the company's website home page: "The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Edelman Berland conducted a study on how U.S. online news users feel about sponsored content and, importantly, what it takes for brands, publishers and agencies to get it right."
From the coverage they got on the filing of the lawsuit, it's clear they know how to get the most mileage out of the internet. It's not nearly as clear that they have a case.
And lastly, yes I do believe that spending money on flyers and PSA's can change people's behavior. Just look at the long running campaign to discourage smoking. There is a multi-year campaign funded from state dollars that has cut the rate of smoking significantly. Let's give this a chance to work.
