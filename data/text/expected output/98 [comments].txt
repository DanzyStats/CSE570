This a BS measure. NO new money will go to "obesity programs". Prop E money will replace other money which will be diverted for other things.
Also, the BOS want to make selling bottled water illegal; first, on City property, eventually, everywhere. Now this 2-cent per ounce tax on the alternative is a real potential money-maker. And who says they are complete idiots (besides me)?
