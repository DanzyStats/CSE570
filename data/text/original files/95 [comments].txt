This "ray of progressive hope" is positioned beautifully next to the one about, the death of global warming action. 2014 elections, the gift that keeps on giving...Has anyone noticed what a beautiful morning/day is unfolding? Not too hot, not too cold...

Nonsense. Tax and bond measures (other than sales tax which is non-discriminatory) and spending measures pass consistently in SF since so many of the voters are renters. The failures are because these measures over-stepped rational behavior. Maybe the recent overturning of the last anti-landlord fee idea had some impact. Chiu and Campos were practically a coin flip, but Campos was more aligned with progressive missteps. SF is clearly saying they will reject some egregious nonsense measures,... » more

@flaneur415 The funny part is that the $15 minimum wage will attract more Central American nationals to move to San Francisco and CA, while at the same time causing American companies to move to Mexico where the federal minimum wage is 90 cents an hour.

Yes, the election results took on quite a different tone in San Francisco as compared to the rest of the nation. But, of course, it was everyone else, outside of San Francisco, who has lost their way.

I just want to ask a fair question to the supporters of Prop G. Some 50,000 S.F. single family homes have the so-called in-law unit, as many home owners need the extra income to subsidize the high housing cost. As you know, this type of housing is subjected to the sales tax under Prop G. Let say Mr. Joe bought a $80o,000 home but within six months he lost his job and force to sell. Assuming he can sell his home for 10% more at $880,000 but he has to pay $211,000 in sales tax. How is this... » more

Why is Mary Jung -the real estate lobbyist- allowed to slant the writing of PROP G - on all ballots and in the official voter information guide? Tim Redmond has the answer:

"Prop G. The campaign manager, Quintin Mecke, told me by email that he had informed the contractor doing the card (50+1 Strategies, which also is doing the Chiu campaign) that the tagline should read:

Stop the evictions!

@z4m Apparently, you represent carpetbagging profiteers who'll gladly bounce people from their homes (88year old lady recently happened to blocks from me) if the dollars add up. Prop G was to make those numbers not add up - the target is clearly flippers - not job creators - not anyone who stabilizes housing nor builds new housing. What the hell is your belief system? The ones benefiting are self-interested investors not working, paying, citizens who pay their taxes and form a community.

Direct democracy can be a scary thing. The fact that over 40% of voters tried to vote an extreme tax onto a small subset of the population is crazy. Yes...Prop G probably would have been thrown out in court but this city can sure have a socialist bent at times. Thank goodness we have the Constitution to protect our rights and property.

The Tea Party is an astroturf group funded by the Koch Bros.; there is no such equivalent for progressives, with or without sneer quotes. (No, Tom Steyer or George Souros don't come anywhere close.)

"Rosenthal argued that the defeats of Prop. E and Prop. G point to the insidious effect of big spending in campaigns — even in San Francisco, where voters like to think of themselves as too smart to be swayed by corporate cash."

The problem with many progressives is they think they are too smart about everything and they refuse to consider any opinion other than their own.

Has anyone ever wondered why increasing the minimum wage is supported by conservatives and the business community? They've figured out that increasing the minimum wage: 1) takes those folks off the public welfare rolls; 2) removes them from the 100% subsidized sector of the affordable care act; and 3) allows businesses to raise their prices under the cover that they are paying their employees a higher wage. Of course, one way to keep cost stable is to hire less employees. So, raise prices... » more
