The Beverage Association of America has poured close to eight million
dollars to defeat the critically important Prop E in San Francisco, which would help put our children and adults with limited access to nutritious food on the path to better health and reduce our healthcare tax burden. There is no debating that! Please help demonstrate that the power of individual voice is still stronger than the power of corporate dollars by voting 'Yes' on Prop E.

I love how people can argue their right to an independent, autonomous decision (i.e. NO NANNY STATE) when they live in a world that is constantly spoon-feeding them ads that inform their decisions. Get real. This is a small fee to discourage (not ban) soda consumption. Soda leads to diabetes. Diabetes is bad. The end.

@MrReid It's also a small fee to cover the costs of healthcare that arise when people regularly drink it. Diabetes is real, and hitting people younger and younger. It is unfortunate, however, that the companies making, selling, and advertising the soda don't have to pay this cost, as it will disproportionately affect the poor, the cost and the illness associated with the sugary drinks.

Not only is soda not a food, it may well be about as beneficial to consume as alcohol. Perhaps the companies... » more

Kudos to Heather Knight for investigating the false claims from No on E. It's great to see journalists exposing some of their underhanded tactics. This issue is too important to let self-interested soda companies stand in the way of making sure kids can grow up healthy.

Thanks for explaining everything, Mr. Peck. Just that - Soda is not "food", nor is it "groceries." By the way, many commenters are just voicing their opinions here, but for those who are paid by the ABA, what's the going rate? Just curious. I hear that anti-soda tax precinct walkers get $15 an hour in Berkeley; dietitians working for the Corn refiners and soda companies are paid to tweet against national soda taxes (see http://www.weightymatters.ca/2014/08/meet-7-registered-dietitians.html),... » more

@TaylorzHaus Although you were misquoted, there is a point to be made about why a city with more dogs than children is trumpeting this tax as being about childhood obesity.

Its just about a tax. And the funds it generates will supposedly be restricted to supporting 'childhood health programs' but it does not mean that any funds already being used for these programs isn't up for grabs.

Its a bait and switch, with a feel good message (its for the children!) but is nothing more than a revenue... » more

Taxing soda is an idea whose time has come - imagine where we'd be today if we hadn't started taxing cigarettes in the 1970s or if we didn't have seat belt laws. Libertarians may bristle but I'm sure most progressive San Franciscans understand that government can play a constructive role in discouraging harmful habits. A soda tax worked to bring down soda consumption in Mexico and it will work here. Yes on E!

Fascinating that Mr. Peck, the ABA's poster child, thinks soda taxes are good enough for Richmond but not for SF. Are Richmond's kids more deserving than the more than 100,000 children who live in San Francisco? Are the alarming number of folks in SF's hospitals awaiting kidney transplants and amputations less important than those suffering from diabetes in Richmond?

All this talk about soda and the problems it causes and we neglect the bigest killer of all. It is one we are all faced with and yet we do nothing about it. I really think we should not tax soda but tax the real killer, old age. That is right. Old age causes more deaths than all of the bad foods combines. If we can just tax it maybe it will go away.

@ilikeitwarm The data is looking very causal given the feeding studies by Stanhope at UC Davis showing that sugary drinks lead to increases in triglycerides, harmful cholesterol (small dense LDL particles), decreases in protective cholesterol (HDL) and increases in liver fat all within two weeks. And sugar consumption has markedly increased if you add sucrose and HFCS and all other sugars together.

So whom, pray tell, should shoulder the expense of our childhood obesity epidemic? Keep in mind that in many cases, parents cannot pay for the cost of their child's obesity.

Seems to me the expense should be borne by those who consume the biggest causes of obesity, and should leave the rest of us water-drinkers alone. Do you not agree?

@lovefelines To reduce soda consumption and lower these staggering rates of diabetes (40% of kids will develop diabetes in their lifetime - a national embarrassment), those concerned with the public's health need to use all of the tools available to them - soda warning labels, excise taxes, getting sugary drinks out of schools, etc. Education alone does not work. Education combined with policy works well.

Tax Farm

I am a serf on a tax farm.
Nearly fifty percent of my wage
Is taken away.

How much more need I pay?
Before I become a slave.

Soda tax, another cash cow for the government. Don't believe the c**p about protecting us from ourselves. It's the government telling you they know what is good for you and you are incapable of making sound choices. Just follow the money, baby!
